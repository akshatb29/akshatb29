# Hey, I'm Akshat 👋  

🚀 Computer Science @ PES University  
💡 I build things that mix **ML, Systems, and a bit of chaos**  
☕ Fueled by coffee, Kafka streams, and late-night debugging  

---

### 🌱 What I’m up to
- Training ML models to detect weird stuff in networks  
- Building full-stack apps (React + FastAPI + a sprinkle of LangChain magic)  
- Experimenting with Federated Learning + Differential Privacy  
- Chasing the sweet spot between **theory and deployment**  

---

### 🛠️ My toolbox
- **Languages**: Python, C++, SQL, JS/TS  
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, React, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Systems**: Docker, Kafka, Elasticsearch  
- **Special tricks**: making things *just work* at 2 AM  

---

### 📈 Currently Grinding On
- SDE prep 📚 (DSA + low-level system design)  
- Side projects that could accidentally become startups  
- Writing README files that are fancier than the project itself  

---

### ✨ Fun Facts
- I believe half of debugging is just *staring aggressively at the screen*  
- I sometimes build ML models just to avoid writing if-else statements  
- My code runs best on **trial & error-driven development**
